## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, part 1

    I enjoyed this lab because we had to calculate a person's basal metabloic rate. I found using the Mifflin St Jeor equation to be intriguing. It was the first lab I was able to be the driver for.

* Lab 8, part 1

    I enjoyed this lab because we had to calculate the average mean of the judge's scores. I found it to be pretty simple. I like problem solving and in this case, the Olympic average.

* Lab 7, part 1

    I enjoyed this lab because we had to write functions that decide wheter parking is allowed and at what time. This was my favorite lab as I felt like I learned a lot. Each street had a different schedule so implementing everything was intresting.
